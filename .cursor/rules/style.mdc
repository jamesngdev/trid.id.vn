Create a complete, modern single-page blog theme that looks and feels exactly like Apple’s current 2025 website design language ("Liquid Glass" style), but with noticeably better UI/UX than Apple’s own site.

Core visual requirements – must feel identical to apple.com (2025):
- Frosted glass (blur + vibrancy) cards with very subtle inner glow
- Extremely thin hairline borders (0.5px or less) with 10-15% opacity
- Pure black (#000000) or pure white (#FFFFFF) background only
- San Francisco Pro typeface (use system-font stack with SF Pro fallback)
- Massive whitespace and heroic typography scale
- Floating layered depth (multiple backdrop-filter blur layers)
- Subtle parallax on scroll (elements move at different speeds)
- Micro-animations: 150-250ms ease-outs, soft spring on hover (scale 1.02–1.05)
- All interactive elements have liquid-like soft glow on hover/focus
- Dark mode first, light mode as toggle (both must look native Apple)

Layout must be 100% identical to Apple’s current homepage/blog structure:
- Full-width hero with huge animated headline + subheadline
- Sticky minimal top navigation bar (transparent → frosted on scroll)
- Large featured post carousel (like Apple’s product carousel)
- Grid of article cards (3–4 columns on desktop, edge-to-edge)
- Article cards use heavy blur backdrop, floating above page
- Sidebar on single post page (like Apple’s product pages)
- Footer exactly like Apple’s (tiny text, bag icon, etc.)

Now make the UI/UX BETTER than Apple’s actual site:
- Faster perceived performance (lazy-load everything, skeleton screens)
- Better accessibility (perfect contrast, focus states, reduced motion option)
- Smarter hover/tap states (larger hit areas, predictive glow)
- Reading progress indicator integrated into scrollbar (like Apple but thinner and frosted)
- Instant dark/light mode toggle with no flash (use CSS variables + prefers-color-scheme)
- Smooth scroll snap on mobile for sections
- Article table of contents that floats and follows like Apple’s but with liquid blur pod
- Related articles section with 3D tilt effect on hover
- Built-in reading time, share sheet (iOS/macOS native style), and save-for-later button
- All images use WebP + AVIF with LCP optimization

Tech stack:
- Next.js 
- Tailwind CSS 
- Framer Motion for animations
- TypeScript
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)
- Include a beautiful syntax highlighter theme matching the glass style

Make it look so close to Apple that people will think it’s an official Apple blog, but noticeably smoother and more delightful to use.
